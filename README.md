# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## WebStorm tip: Show brackets in different colors (Rainbow Brackets)

If you want WebStorm to color each nested pair of brackets/braces/parentheses differently ("rainbow" colors), enable the builtâ€‘in Rainbow Brackets feature:

- WebStorm 2022.3 and later
  1. Open Settings/Preferences (Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows/Linux, Cmd+, on macOS).
  2. Go to Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Rainbow.
  3. Check "Rainbow parentheses", "Rainbow braces", and optionally "Rainbow brackets" and "Rainbow method brackets".
  4. Apply and OK.

- Older versions (when a separate plugin was used)
  - Install/enable the "Rainbow Brackets" plugin via Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ Marketplace, then configure it under Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Rainbow.

Manual perâ€‘language colors (alternative)
- You can also manually change bracket colors per language via:
  Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Language Defaults â†’ Braces and Operators, Parentheses, Brackets â†’ set Foreground colors.
  This wonâ€™t autoâ€‘cycle by nesting depth, but lets you pick fixed colors.

Troubleshooting
- If you donâ€™t see colors, ensure the active color scheme supports them (Editor â†’ Color Scheme). Both Light and Darcula schemes work; custom schemes may override settings.
- You can export/import your color scheme via File â†’ Manage IDE Settings â†’ Export/Import Settings if you want to share these with teammates.


### If you don't see the "Rainbow" section in WebStorm
- You may be on an older WebStorm version. The builtâ€‘in Rainbow settings were added in 2022.3. Update WebStorm to 2022.3+ and check again under Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Rainbow.
- If updating isnâ€™t an option, install the Rainbow Brackets plugin: Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ Marketplace â†’ search for "Rainbow Brackets" â†’ Install/Enable â†’ restart IDE. Then configure it under Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Rainbow.
- Ensure your active color scheme isnâ€™t overriding or hiding rainbow settings. Try switching to the default Darcula or Light scheme (Settings â†’ Editor â†’ Color Scheme), then revisit Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Rainbow.
- As a manual alternative per language: Editor â†’ Color Scheme â†’ Language Defaults â†’ Braces and Operators / Parentheses / Brackets â†’ set Foreground colors. This wonâ€™t autoâ€‘cycle by nesting depth but lets you pick fixed colors.

Quick test snippet for bracket coloring (paste into a .js or .ts file):

```js
function globalFunction({ options = {} }) {
  const { minLength } = options;

  /**
   * @description Validator
   * @param {string?} value - parameter description
   */
  const localFunction = value => {
    let isValid = value?.length >= minLength ?? 3; // line comment
    /* Block comment */
    isValid = isValid && (/^\d.[A-F]+$/i).test(value);
    return {
      isValid,
    };
  };
}

@defineElement("download-button")
class DownloadButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
  static STATIC_FIELD = `<span title="HTML injection">${globalVariable}</span>`;

  static get observedAttributes() {
    return [ 'data-test' ];
  }

  #field = { prop: 1 };
  
  method() {
    this.click();
      
    label:
      while (true) {
        break label;
      }
  }
}

export const EXPORTED_VARIABLE = 1;
export function exportedFunction() {}
export class ExportedClass {}

const globalVariable = "chars\n\u11";

function JsxComponent() {
  return <JsxClientComponent />;
}
```
